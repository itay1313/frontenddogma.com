### Privacy Policy

Responsible for data protection, particularly around European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Jens Oliver Meiert.

In line with other privacy policies, this policy makes use of a rather formal language. You’re still most welcome on this website.

#### Your Rights

Using the contact data provided you can at any time exercise the following rights:

* information about your data stored with us as well as the processing thereof,
* correction of inaccurate personal data,
* deletion of your data stored with us,
* restriction of data processing when legal requirements prohibit to delete your data,
* objection against the processing of your data, and
* data portability if you agreed to the processing of your data or entered a contract with us.

You can at any time revoke your consent.

You can also at any time file a complaint with the supervisory authority in charge. You can find a list of addresses for the respective authorities in the European Commission’s [overview of national data protection authorities](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080).

#### Purposes of Data Processing

We process any personally identifiable information only to the purposes listed in this policy. There’s no transfer of your personal data other than for the purposes mentioned. We transfer any of your personal data only if:

* you gave your express consent,
* the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you,
* the processing is necessary to fulfill other legal obligations,
* the processing serves the meeting of justified interests while there’s no reason to assume that you have a greater protection-worthy interest in your data not being transferred.

#### Deletion or Detention of Data

We adhere to the principles of data reduction and frugality. We only store data for as long as it’s necessary for the purposes mentioned or as legal retention periods require. Once purposes or retention periods cease to apply, the data get blocked or removed pursuant to the applicable legal provisions.

#### Encryption

For data protection reasons your data are transferred over HTTPS.

#### Server Logs

The hosting provider of this website ([ALL-INKL.COM](https://all-inkl.com/PA68572347FA65)) collects and stores some information transferred by your browser in so called server log files. This information includes:

* host name
* IP address
* operating system
* browser
* referrer URL
* time of server request

We’ve signed a data processing agreement with ALL-INKL.COM, requiring ALL-INKL.COM to protect our users’ data and not hand over data to third parties.

The data are not combined or merged with other sources of data.

Processing of the data happens pursuant to Art.&nbsp;6 ¶&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;f GDPR, allowing the processing of data for the purposes of contractual compliance.

In the server statistics available to us, IP addresses are anonymized and all log files get deleted after 30 days.

#### Email

When you contact us through email, your inquiry and the information provided are saved in order to process and follow up on the inquiry. The data are not handed over to third parties without your consent.

Processing of the data contained in the email happens pursuant to your permission (Art.&nbsp;6 ¶&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;a GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time, for example through an email to us. The withdrawal does not affect the legal validity of processing of the data.

The data provided are saved until you ask us to delete the data, revoke your consent to store the data, or until the purpose for storing the data falls away. This does not overrule any applicable legal requirements, as with retention periods.

We use Gmail and ProtonMail for email, each additionally secured with two-factor authentication. Please refer to [Google’s](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [ProtonMail’s privacy policies](https://protonmail.com/privacy-policy) for details.

#### VG Wort

This website uses session cookies of [VG Wort](https://www.vgwort.de/) in order to measure access to editorial content, and VG Wort, in turn, makes use of the _Skalierbares Zentrales Messverfahren_ (SZM, “scalable central measurement system”) of INFOnline GmbH for the detection of statistical parameters so as to determine the probability of copies of content. This measuring happens pursuant to Art.&nbsp;6 ¶&nbsp;1 lit.&nbsp;f GDPR.

In the process, anonymous metrics are collected. To recognize computer systems, the measurement either employs a session cookie or a signature generated through a set of data automatically transmitted by your browser. IP addresses are only used in an anonymized fashion. At no point single users are being identified; your identity remains protected. You don’t receive advertising through the system.

Session cookies are small units of information saved by a service provider on the computer of their user. A session cookie contains a randomly generated identification number, the so-called session ID. On top of that, a cookie contains information about its origin and the period of time it’s being stored. Session cookies cannot save any other data. Using session cookies, VG Wort enables their authors to participate in VG Wort distribution payments that ensure compensation for the use of otherwise copyright-protected works in accordance with §&nbsp;53 UrhG. If you don’t wish to partake in SZM measuring, you can opt out at [optout.ioam.de](https://optout.ioam.de/).

#### Miscellaneous

To improve the performance of this website and allow you faster access to it, files like images, style sheets, and scripts are provided through the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) by Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS may save data related to this use. Please refer to the [AWS privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/) for details.

In order not to simply point to information and products but to make it easier to obtain them, some links on this website are so-called affiliate links. When you click on and purchase through such an affiliate link, we receive a commission from the respective provider. Affiliate links do not mean price changes for you.

Sporadically, this website uses [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) in order to check for compliance with [security policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy). This is both for the general security of your data as well as for the enforcement of provisions made in this document, and it happens only sporadically to serve both security and privacy. Similar to other external services, for details on how Sentry works with data, please refer to [Sentry’s privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

#### Changes

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy in order to comply with legal requirements and to reflect changes to our website and services. For your later visits to this website, any new privacy policy applies.

#### Questions

If you have any questions related to the privacy and protection of your data, please email us or contact the person responsible for data protection: Jens Oliver Meiert (contact data above).
