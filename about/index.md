Frontend Dogma is three things:

1. A quality-minded source for frontend development news and commentary. Not the most ambitious and comprehensive one—Frontend Dogma will feature other sites that do that—but one that aims to promote quality information.
2. A humble publishing platform, first to focus on publishing and promoting web development ebooks.
3. An unpredictable cause. For a start, Frontend Dogma puts emphasis on HTML and CSS validation by featuring [the validation pledge](/pledge/).

Frontend Dogma will be a little biased ([thanks, Jens](https://meiert.com/en/)), but that’s hard to avoid on a website.
