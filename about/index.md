Frontend Dogma is a project by [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/), a former Google tech lead, a frontend engineering manager, and an O’Reilly but also independent [author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert). [Personal note: I’m still unsure what voice to assume here. I’ll keep it a bit distant for now, but there’s a living, breathing being behind this site.]

Frontend Dogma is an outlet for three purposes. With the site being built and grown, focus lies on the first of these purposes.

## 1. A Source

Frontend Dogma aims to be a decent source for frontend development. Not spectacular, but decent: Share meaningful information; make that information easy to access (via [feed]({{ metadata.feed.path | url }}) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontenddogma)); give good credit to authors and publishers (with “do follow” links and ample Twitter mentions).

## 2. A Publisher

Frontend Dogma is a small and humble publisher of books about frontend development. The [first titles](/books/) are all ebooks by Frontend Dogma’s founder, Jens Oliver Meiert. Over time, Frontend Dogma will feature other authors and book types. If you are an author writing about frontend development, [get in touch](/contact/) for how Frontend Dogma and you could fit together.

—Frontend Dogma, by the way, is about convictions, but not truly about dogma. [Site feedback and contributions](https://github.com/j9t/frontenddogma.com) are welcome.
