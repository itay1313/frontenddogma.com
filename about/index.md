Frontend Dogma is a project by [Jens Oliver Meiert](https://meiert.com/en/), a former Google tech lead, a frontend engineering manager, and an O’Reilly but also independent [author](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert). [Personal note: I’m still unsure what voice to assume here. I’ll keep it a bit distant for now, but there’s a living, breathing being behind this site.]

Frontend Dogma is going to serve as an outlet for three purposes. As the site is being established and extended, focus lies on one of these purposes.

## 1. A Source

Frontend Dogma aims to become a decent source for frontend development news and commentary. Not spectacular, but decent: The idea is to promote meaningful information, easy to consume ([per feed]({{ metadata.feed.path | url }}) and [through Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontenddogma)), supportive of authors and publishers with “do follow” links and friendly Twitter references.

Frontend Dogma, by the way, shares convictions, but isn’t dogmatic. [Feedback and contributions](https://github.com/j9t/frontenddogma.com) are welcome.
