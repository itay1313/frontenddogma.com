This is Frontend Dogma. Frontend Dogma is still being set up. What is Frontend Dogma going to be?

1. A quality-minded source for frontend development news and commentary. Not the most ambitious and comprehensive one—Frontend Dogma will feature other sites that do that—but one that promotes meaningful and impactful information, and one that gives more credit than other sources do.

2. An independent publishing platform, releasing and promoting web development ebooks. This is based on [Jens’s](https://meiert.com/en/) experience working with [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) and publishing [his own indie titles](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert).

3. An unpredictable and possibly changing cause. In the beginning, Frontend Dogma is likely to put emphasis on HTML and CSS validation, by featuring [a validation pledge](/pledge/).

Frontend Dogma isn’t actually designed to be dogmatic, but it will share convictions. [Contributions](https://github.com/j9t/frontenddogma.com) and therefore external input are (going to be) welcome.
