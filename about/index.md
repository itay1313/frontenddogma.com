Frontend Dogma is still being set up. What is Frontend Dogma?

1. A selective quality source for frontend development news and commentary. A source that promotes meaningful and impactful information, that is easy to consume [per feed]({{ metadata.feed.path | url }}) and [through Twitter](https://twitter.com/frontenddogma), and that gives ample credit.

2. An unpredictable and varying cause. In the beginning, Frontend Dogma is going to put emphasis on HTML and CSS validation, by featuring [a validation pledge](/pledge/).

3. An independent publishing platform. (This will take a bit of time.)

Frontend Dogma hasnâ€™t actually been designed to be dogmatic. However, it will share convictions. [Contributions and feedback](https://github.com/j9t/frontenddogma.com) are welcome.
