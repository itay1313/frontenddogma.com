Frontend Dogma is three things:

1. A decent source for frontend development news and opinions. Not the most ambitious and comprehensive one—Frontend Dogma will feature other sites that do that—but one that still aims to promote quality information.
2. A humble publishing platform, first to to focus on publishing and promoting web development ebooks.
3. An unpredictable cause. For a start, Frontend Dogma will put emphasis on HTML and CSS validation by featuring [the validation pledge](/pledge/).

Frontend Dogma will be a little biased ([thanks Jens](https://meiert.com/en/)), but that’s hard to avoid on any website.
