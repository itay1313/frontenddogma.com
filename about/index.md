Frontend Dogma is still being set up. What is Frontend Dogma going to be?

1. A quality-focused source for frontend development news and commentary. Not the most ambitious and comprehensive one—it will depend on how much time and support there is for the project—but one that promotes meaningful and impactful information, and one that gives ample credit.

2. An independent publishing platform, releasing and promoting web development ebooks. This originates in [Jens’s](https://meiert.com/en/) experience working with [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/) as well as publishing [his own indie titles](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/13623828.Jens_Oliver_Meiert).

3. An unpredictable and varying cause. In the beginning, Frontend Dogma is going to put emphasis on HTML and CSS validation, by featuring [a validation pledge](/pledge/).

Frontend Dogma isn’t actually designed to be dogmatic, but will share convictions. [Contributions](https://github.com/j9t/frontenddogma.com) and external input are welcome.
