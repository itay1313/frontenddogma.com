[Validating HTML and CSS](https://www.htmlvalidator.com/htmlval/whyvalidate.html) is important to confirm that the respective code is in conformance with the HTML and CSS standards. This not only ensures use of actual HTML and CSS, but it also helps to avoid technical as well as user-facing problems.

Validating also comes with the benefit of learning about the underlying standards, which supports our growth as web professionals.

Not validating, and therefore producing and shipping invalid code, is something that anyone can do. Only through the practice of validation can we actually speak of a craft and profession of web and frontend development.

In [_In Critical Defense of Frontend Development_](https://meiert.com/en/blog/critical-frontend-development/) I (Jens Oliver Meiert, who also runs Frontend Dogma) share more about the situation and why we as frontend developers benefit from committing to validation. Have a critical look yourself, and share your thoughts on how we can step it up for our field.
