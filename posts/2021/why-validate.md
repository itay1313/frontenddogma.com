[Validating HTML and CSS](https://www.htmlvalidator.com/htmlval/whyvalidate.html) is important to confirm that the respective code is in conformance with the HTML and CSS standards. This not only ensures use of actual HTML and CSS, but it also helps to avoid errors.

Validating also comes with the benefit of learning about the underlying standards, which supports the growth as web professionals.

Not validating, and therefore producing and shipping invalid code, is something that anyone can do. The practice of not validating is therefore one that has nothing to do with the craft and the profession of web and frontend development.

[_In Critical Defense of Frontend Development_](https://meiert.com/en/blog/critical-frontend-development/) shares more about the situation and why we as frontend developers as well as the field of frontend development benefit from committing to validation.
