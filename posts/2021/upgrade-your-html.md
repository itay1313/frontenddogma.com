title: Upgrade Your HTML
---
> The _Upgrade Your HTML_ series is about one thing: Picking examples of HTML in the wild, and explaining how to make that code better. Kindly. Constructively. Thoroughly, as finding a balance between detail and brevity permits.

It’s still “top secret” and part of a bigger plan, but Frontend Dogma is going to be the publisher of the _Upgrade Your HTML_ book series!
